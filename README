5. Run cryptominisat using 				'./cryptominisat CNF-FILE'

--- Usage ---
Run cryptominisat with a cnf-file. We provide some files to test on in the 'Tests' directory. 
Running the file will create 2 new files in the current working directory. 
Input cnf files can be either standard cnf files, or cnf files containing xor-clauses.
- "cryptominisat_proof_log_final.cnf" will contain the veriPB proof.
- "cryptominisat_cnf_log_final.cnf" will contain the cnf file on which the proof has to be verified.
Additional information concerning usage can be found in the original readme file which is included under the name ORIG_README
